## Cryptocurrency Clustering Project

This Challenge involves clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
The goal is to identify meaningful patterns and groupings in cryptocurrency data by reducing dimensionality and applying clustering techniques.



## Getting Started
* Prerequisites
* Python 3.x
* Required Python libraries:
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* hvplot
* matplotlib
* yellowbrick (New module that I used for advanced clustering evaluation) Code: pip install yellowbrick

## Usage
* Data Preparation:

Load and clean cryptocurrency data.
Scale the data using standard scaling methods.

* Dimensionality Reduction:
Apply PCA to reduce the data to three principal components.

## References
Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.

* Clustering:
Use K-Means to cluster the data.
Determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.

* Visualization:
Generate plots to visualize clustering results and elbow curves.
